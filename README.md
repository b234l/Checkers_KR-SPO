## This project was created in 2022 as a coursework on the subject of "SOftware Systems".

## Goal is to create a simple game with simple rules, using only the capabilities of C# and two .png images - white and black checkers figure. Game is designed for two players

## Lauching project will open form in wich there will be a board model 8x8 and 24 figures of two colors.
